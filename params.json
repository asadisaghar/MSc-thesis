However, its subgalactic-scale predictions are plagued by a number of unsettled questions. One such issue is “the missing satellites problem”. Along with the theoretical model, observational\r\naspects of cosmology have also been substantially improved during the past century. The perspective of new radio arrays in the near future promises very high resolution observations in this field. Regarding gravitational lensing effects, obtaining sufficient observational data with submilliarcsecond angular resolution would shed light on such subgalactic challenges of\r\nthe cold dark matter model. In this endeavour, performing simulations to imitate what the observational data of such telescopes would look like, provides us with a deeper insight on the type of sources and frequency bands in which we expect to detect the desired lensing effects.\r\n\r\nIn the present work, we run a series of simulations which examine the detectability of three different dark halo substructures with different VLBI observational modes. \r\n\r\nOur results show that to detect lensing signatures made by standard dark halo substructures with current and foreseeing VLBI observational modes, we need to focus on large sources, such as radio-loud quasars which are manifested as ∼100-pc sized jets in certain frequency bands. However, if, as some astronomers propose, some fraction of the dark matter is in the form of intermediate-mass black holes with masses ranging from ∼1e3 solar mass to ∼1e6 solar mass, these observations should be able to confirm it.",
